# recipe_keep_project

This is a Flutter Project that I created for CS4381:Cross-Platform Application Development.
The program is a Recipe storage and organizer that allows the user to create and saves recipes.
Saved recipes are displayed in card widgets and can be sorted by, filtered, and searched using their recipe names or ingredients.
Each recipe card widget can be selected to view a detailed overview of the recipe that contains the ingredients, picture, link to source, instructions, nutritional facts and tags.
A randomizer feature is also included to spin a wheel that contains all stored recipes, a random recipe is selected.
